# Fred's Fridge


**Team Members:** `Abhiram Yammanuru, Sarayu Vjiayanagaram`

## ðŸ’¬ Elevator Pitch

`Fred's Fridge is an app made for families for them to connect over their own virtual "fridge"`

## Inspiration


`One of the central locations at home for many families is their refrigerator. They generally have some kind of calendar, pictures, and shopping lists. Each family's fridge is personal and intimate. Your family's highest moments get highlighted on this fridge. Fred's Fridge takes that space and digitizes it, providing a platform for families to be more interconnected. This is catered towards Fred, who is someone who cares a lot about family. The main problem that this solves for him is a way for him to stay connected to his family, in a way that is very homey. For someone like Fred, who seems like the type of guy to have a family some day, it would be a great app to connect with his new family as well. `

## What It Does


- **Shopping List:** `The shopping list is a part of the fridge in which a user can add an item to it, and can click on that specific item to run a strikethrough thru it. Similar to reminders, but catered towards shopping.`

- **Reminders:** `Reminders is a part of the fridge in which a user can add a reminder to a list of reminders, and can click on it to run a strikethrough thru it. Similar to shopping list, but catered towards general reminders and to-dos.`

- **Sticky Notes:** `Sticky notes have their own button, in which a user can add text and add a virtual sticky note to the fridge.`

- **Photos:** `Photos have their own button in which a user can add their own images to personalize the family's fridge.`

- **Users:** `You are able to assign events to Users and are able to switch users`

## How We Built It


- **Frontend:** `React, Vite, JavaScript, CSS, SVG Assets`

- **Backend:** `Python, Flask`


## Challenges We Ran Into


`The biggest challenge that we ran into was local storage. We wanted there to be a way in which we could reload the page and have specific items (such as sticky notes and photos) to stay and not be refreshed.`

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of


`We are most proud of the UI for the photos. Not only do they import without many issues, they have a cute red "magnet" at the top which gives it a more realistic view. It's a very small thing, but I feel like it really puts things together. It also creates a small border for each of the photos, further making them look more realistic and cuter.`

## What We Learned


`As mentioned in our challenges section, we learned about local storage, which was something that we didn't have experience with before. Additionally, we gained a lot more experience experimenting with UI and React components.`

## What's Next for

`One of the biggest things we were trying to implement (but didn't have time), was drag and drop functionality. This would have been something that could've completely revamped the personalization of Fred's Fridge, and would have made it more unique and tailored. This would have been the direction that we would have taken the project in.`
