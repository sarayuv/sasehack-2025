Fred's Fridge

**Team Members:** `Abhiram Yammanuru, Sarayu Vjiayanagaram`

## ðŸ’¬ Elevator Pitch

`Fred's Fridge is an app made for families for them to connect over their own virtual "fridge"`

## Inspiration


`So, one of the central locations for many families is their refrigerator. They usually have some kind of calendar, images of the family, and shopping lists. Each families refrigerator is personal and intimate. Fred's Fridge take's that space and digitizes it, providing a platform for families to be more interconnected. Your family's highest moments get highlighted on this fridge. This is catered towards Fred, who is someone who cares a lot about family. The main problem that this solves for him is a way for him to stay connected to his family, in a way that is very homey. For someone like Fred, who seems like the type of guy to have a family some day, it would be a great app to connect with his new family as well. `

## How We Built It


- **Frontend:** `React, Vite, JavaScript, CSS, SCG Assets`

- **Backend:** `Python, Flask`


## Challenges We Ran Into


`The biggest challenge that we ran into was local storage. We wanted there to be a way in which we could reload the page and have specific items (such as sticky notes and photos) to stay and not be refreshed. It took some googling, but we were able to understand it and get it working`. 

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of


`We are most proud of the UI for the photos. Not only do they import without many issues, they have a cute red "magnet" at the top which gives it a more realistic view. It's a very small thing, but I feel like it really puts things together. It also creates a small border for each of the photos, further making them look more realistic and cuter.`

## What We Learned


`As mentioned in our challenges section, we learned about local storage, which was something that we didn't have experience with before. Additionally, we gained a lot more experience experimenting with UI and React components.`

## What's Next for

`One of the biggest things we were trying to implement (but didn't have time), was drag and drop functionality. This would have been something that could've completely revamped the personalization of Fred's Fridge, and would have made it more unique and tailored. This would have been the direction that we would have taken the project in.`
